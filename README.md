# fabric-store-tools
A collection of tools and code to facilitate running a fabric or wallpaper online store with hundreds of thousands of products.

## OLD CODE
Please be warned that this code is from around circa 2015 and there hasn't been any attempt to keep it current. It likely doesn't compile in its current form into a usable production-ready module, however, there are many code pieces which are indeed complete and very useful as a reference model for building the back end of a highly-scalable upholstery fabric or wallpaper online store which handles many hundreds of thousands of products.
