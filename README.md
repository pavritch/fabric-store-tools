# Fabric Store Tools
A collection of tools and code to facilitate running a fabric or wallpaper online store with hundreds of thousands of products. A bit outdated, but previously used in production for a long time.

## This is Old Code
Please be warned that this code is from around circa 2015 and there hasn't been any attempt to keep it current. It likely doesn't compile in its current form into a usable production-ready module, however, there are many code pieces which are indeed complete and very useful as a reference model for building the back end of a highly-scalable upholstery fabric or wallpaper online store which handles many hundreds of thousands of products.

These projects were originally developed using Visual Studio 2012/2013. 

Some proprietary DLLs have been deleted, for example: Telerik, Intersoft commerical UX libraries. For this reason alone, the source won't directly compile.
